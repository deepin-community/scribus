  opened (and saved) a file with this version of scribus there is no way back to

scribus-ng (1.4.0.dfsg+r17300-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This is a dummy transitional package to converge both scribus and
  scribus-ng on the 1.4.0 release. Please install the "scribus" package and
  remove scribus-ng. At some point scribus-ng will be switched to 1.5.0svn.

scribus (1.3.9.dfsg+svn20110210-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This is a Qt4 developmental branch converging to a stable 1.4.0 release.
  File format in 1.3.x is incompatible with the earlier releases based on
  Qt3 (1.3.3.x packages). There is no going back! Stay with Debian Stable if
  you need to use a 1.3.3.x package. Use this package when you are ready to
  transition to the 1.3.x series. However, be aware that after this upload
  there will no longer be a 1.3.3.x package in Debian, so it's a good time to
  start planning your transition.
